# MySQL-Chat-App-Backend

This is the backend I built for an upcoming chat app application. It uses graphql for it's API and fetches data from a MySQL database. Current functionality allows 
for user registration, logins, creating chats and appending to chats. The authentication is with JWS tokens. Further improvements will include adding a web application 
and a mobile app to interact with the API.
